Algorithm:
1. create contrast map
    a. iterate through image and store each pixels gradient, ie. the abs difference between it and the average of its neighbors
2. order contrast map from highest contrast to lowest contrast
3. iterate through contrast map and dither each pixel, diffusing error to undithered neighbors (highest contrast first)
